# SketchCollab
SketchCollab is an android application that let's you collaborate in sketchware without any hassle. It is similar to github, but specialized for sketchware.

### Versions
* ***Release:*** Unreleased, still in development
* ***Development:*** Unknown, project is unfinished

### So, what's the deal?
Sketchware users are usually using the one-way-sending project way of collaborating, or sending the modifided project to the other person, until they finished modifying it / improving it, and the cycle goes on and on. *(Showed in diagram below)*

This is a very slow and an inefficient way of collaborating, because you will need to wait for your partner to finish the editing if you want to make changes on the project.

<br/>
SketchCollab break these limits, SketchCollab allows you to edit the project at the same time as someone is editing the project, this makes development not only faster, but also easier. <i>(Shown in diagram on the right)</i>

## ðŸ“œ Note
I didn't invent version control. SketchCollab is only a version control system for Sketchware projects.

## Branches
 - main: Latest tested and stable branch
 - dev: Development branch, unstable, unchecked, and untested
 - old-java: The old Java and unfinished version of SketchCollab
